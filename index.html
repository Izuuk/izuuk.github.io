      <h2 style="font-size: 3rem;">About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        I am a music creator based in Pembrokeshire, Wales, specializing in music composition, for which I hold a Master's degree. 
        <br><br>
        I focus primarily on contemporary music, including pop and electronic genres. I collaborate closely with other musicians and clients to create music tailored to their specific needs. I maintain an open mind towards composition.
        <br><br>
        My main interests in music include experimental pop, soundtrack composition, the relationship between math and music, and music as a form of expression. During my final year of undergraduate studies, I concentrated on the use of pop music in marginalized communities and its impact on society. I enjoy discussing music and the world surrounding it.
